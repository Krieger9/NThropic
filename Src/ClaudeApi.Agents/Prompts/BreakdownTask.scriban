Given the following task, we would like to walk someone through the process of completing it.
The goal is to break it down into steps as simple as possible and then to be delgated to individuals who can complete each step.
Those that are doing the work come in varying degrees of experience, skill and intelligence, but the higher the capacity of the individual the price increases.
We'd like to break the steps down as simple as possible to reduce costs and to make it easier to delegate to lower skilled individuals.
However accuracy and proper implementation is the top priority.
We do not want to break down a step unecessarily, so when given a task that should be solvable by a single person with no benefit to breaking it down, return just the task itself.
